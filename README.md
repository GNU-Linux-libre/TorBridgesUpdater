# Tor Bridges Updater

### Update your Tor bridges on a schedule

![Tor Bridges Updater Window](app_window.png "Tor Bridges Updater Window")

**Tor Bridges Updater** helps you to retrieve Tor [bridges](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/bridges/), and reminds you to retrieve them. Updating your bridges in time helps you circumvent censorship, as older bridges can get blocked.

It can also add new bridges to your `torrc` file. If you don't have access to `bridges.torproject.org`, you can specify a proxy for connection.
